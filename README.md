## Additional Considerations & Potential Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Database Performance:** Large resource collections may require query optimization and indexing strategies
- **File Management:** PDF storage and delivery may require CDN integration for performance
- **Search Functionality:** May need to implement full-text search or integrate with external search services
- **Content Moderation:** Spam prevention and quality control systems will be crucial for community contributions

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** All user-submitted content must be sanitized and validated
- **File Upload Security:** PDF uploads need virus scanning and file type validation
- **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Content Licensing:** Need to address copyright and fair use for shared resources

### Scalability Planning
- **Database Scaling:** Plan for read replicas and potential sharding as user base grows
- **CDN Integration:** Static assets and PDFs should be served via CDN
- **Caching Strategy:** Implement Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
- **Analytics Integration:** Plan for user behavior tracking and performance monitoring

### Community Management
- **Moderation Tools:** Build comprehensive tools for content review and user management
- **Quality Standards:** Establish and enforce content quality guidelines
