## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Examples:
```
feat: add search functionality to content cards
fix: resolve memory leak in scraping worker
docs: update README with new installation steps
```

### JavaScript/React Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to the following:

- Use ES6+ features
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier for formatting)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### CSS/Tailwind Styleguide

- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS when possible
- Follow the BEM methodology for custom CSS classes
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where applicable
- Update documentation when making code changes
- Follow the existing documentation structure
